This is Ze Jiang's home on the web. 

## A short introduction
I am an engineer, hydro-climatologist and researcher. My research focuses on drought detection and attribution, as well as prediction using GCM simulations. I mainly use statistical tools to carry out my research works. I am also an R enthusiast.

PROFILE:
* Highly self-motivated researcher with demonstrated research expertise modeling hydro-climatological processes. 
* Strong interpersonal skills with a good sense of teamwork.
* Programming Skills: R, C/C++, VBA, and Python.
* Rich experience in modeling and GIS, using MIKE, SWMM, DSSAT, and QGIS.

RESEARCH INTEREST:
* Wavelet based time series decomposition and transformation
* Hydro-climatological forecasting and downscaling
* Climate change impact on the water cycle (e.g. floods and droughts)
